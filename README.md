# EcoSystemSimulation
A little program, which simulates an ecosystem with rabbits, foxes and plants.
It was written for my presentation about natural selection which did not take place due to the coronavirus.
# Compile
Compilation was tested with Linux (g++) and Windows (mingw, msvc) in Qt Creator. When compiling for Windows you need to add __LIBS += -lOpengl32__ in the _.pro_ file.

# Run
## Windows
Download the Windows zip file from the Release site and extract it. Run EcoSystemSimulation.exe from the main folder.

## Linux

Download the Linux zip file from the Release site and extract it. Run EcoSystemSimulation.sh from the main folder.

# Note
This is just a private project which was never meant to be public, so you might find some spelling mistakes in the source code.
